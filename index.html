                        description:"The XF was developed at Jaguars Whitley design and development HQ in Coventry and is built at Castle Bromwich Assembly facility in Birmingham. During its development the XF was known by its codename X250.The XF was launched at the 2007 Frankfurt Motor Show,[5][6] following the public showing of the C-XF concept in January 2007 at the North American International Auto Show. Designed by Jaguar's design director Ian Callum,[7] it was a significant design change from its predecessor. The styling of the finalised production XF varies from that of the C-XF, most notably around the front lights and nose, which incorporates an oval mesh grille harking back to the original Jaguar XJ of 1968. The boot lid retained the S-Type's chromed blade to its edge, but also included a leaper. Jaguar logo as well. The interior included some unique features such as the air conditioning vents which are flush-fitting in the dash, rotating open once the engine is started, and a rotating gearshift dial called the JaguarDrive Selector which rises out of the centre console.[8] Another departure from the traditional Jaguar cabin ambiance is the use of pale-blue backlighting to the instruments, switchgear, and around major control panels. Some minor systems, such as the interior lighting, are controlled simply by touching the light covers. The glove compartment also opens to the touch. Unusually the XF has no cloth interior option, with even the entry level model being fully trimmed in leather - even areas that have employed plastic on previous Jaguars. Real wood veneers are available, but have been joined by aluminium, carbon fibre and piano black lacquer trims to create a modern look to the passenger compartment.",

                        description:"First, I am new to Kate Spade. I was looking for a certain type of wallet and KS just happened to fit the bill (no pun intended). I love the wee bit smaller size for a wallet that can hold a checkbook as I am tired of the so large wallets all the time. However, wanting to keep my checkbook with everything else, it has been a challenge. I love the simplicity of this wallet, the great leather and the snap which snaps easily and every time with ease. It would be perfect if it said nothing (Sorry Kate) on it. I read a a review that was concerned about the letters rubbing off. I think mine are there to stay! I will use this wallet until it falls apart!",
